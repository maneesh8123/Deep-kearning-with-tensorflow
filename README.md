training mnist data  (The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.)

This model is basically for predicting hand written number of image....

### Output Demo

print(np.argmax(new_model.predict(x_train)[0]))

output is digit 5

plt.imshow(x_train[0])
plt.show()
